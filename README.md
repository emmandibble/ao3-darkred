# ao3-darkred
A custom CSS theme for archiveofourown.com

## Design
The goal was to create a dark mode theme on AO3 that was accented with the red of the usual logo. This was to increase eye comfort and visibility when using the site at night.

The background value is `#080808` and the accented color value is `#f2f2f2`.
