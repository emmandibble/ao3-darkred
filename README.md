# ao3-darkgreen
A custom CSS theme for archiveofourown.com

## Design
The goal was to create a dark mode theme on AO3 that was accented with a dark green color. This was to increase eye comfort and visibility when using the site at night.

The background value is `#080808` and the accented color value is `#008411`.

## Images (TBD) (the code is a total mess rn and only works on some pages)
